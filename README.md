ogmios
======

Ogmios is a REST service to manage events.

The main goals of the Ogmios project are :
- to define Data providers 
- each provider is able to declare a set of events in order to collect them for a configurable period of time.

The other goal is clearly to provide me a way to learn Scala and linked stack...
