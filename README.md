ogmios
======

Ogmios is a REST service to manage metrics and events.

The main goals of the Ogmios project are :
- to define Data providers 
- each provider is able to declare a set of metrics in order to collect them for a configurable period of time.
- based on these metrics events linked to a provider can be generated by ogmios (to execute a process for example)
- events can also be sent to Ogmios by the provider itself

The other goal is clearly to provide me a way to learn Scala and linked stack...

Currently, Ogmios can perform CRUD actions on provider, create/read events and metrics.
The beans (provider/metric/event) will evolve according to implementation requirements.
